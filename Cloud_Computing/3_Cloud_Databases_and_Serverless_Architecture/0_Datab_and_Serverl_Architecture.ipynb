    "# Cloud Databases and Serverless Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [Serverless Computing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsVyjGpWJa4)\n",
    "\n",
    "Serverless computing is a managed compute resource that provides backend services without the need for you to manage any infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Focus on development, not infrastructure\n",
    "* Reduce the need for DevOps expertise\n",
    "* Cost-effective - pay only for fractions of a second\n",
    "* Infinite scalability\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [Lesson Outline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQpgXzG9b5k)\n",
    "3. [Big Picture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1mJatn8w-8)\n",
    "4. [ElastiCache](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjjTITMkL5U)\n",
    "\n",
    "What type of database does the ElastiCache for Redis managed service provide?\n",
    "* In-memory NoSQL database\n",
    "\n",
    "5. IAM Policies\n",
    "6. [Solution: ElastiCache Exercise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xafrdiyuIAg)\n",
    "\n",
    "When an elastiCache instance reboots, the data is lost, unless you enable multi AZ failover. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. [Lambda Functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sry8ZZF0ONo)\n",
    "8. [Quiz: Lambda Functions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1Mt7pioD7Q)\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you add code with dependencies to Lambda?\n",
    "\n",
    "* If a function has dependencies, those dependencies must be packaged in a zip file and uploaded to Lambda. Code without dependencies can be written directly in the AWS console.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.  [Solution: Hello from Lambda Exercise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2Z2DqZopRw)\n",
    "10. [Solution: Lambda Events Exercise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ta-z9Qf1wlM)\n",
    "11. [Solution: Packaging Code For Lambda Deployment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1H-U0UIvTc)\n",
    "12. [Exercise: Uploading a Lambda Function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PInUmbP0g6s)\n",
    "13. [Testing Lambda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST95E8mTqow)\n",
    "\n",
    "A Lambda Function is invoked and tested by Configuring test events. Often a Lambda Function will receive events from other AWS services. Test events have all the templates for these triggers.\n",
    "\n",
    "14.  [Exercise: Testing Lambda]\n",
    "15.  [Solution: Testing Lambda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdX2p2zYWVA)\n",
    "16.  [API Gateway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk9XJCdosl0)\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to configure an API Gateway with a Lambda function would be to use the triggers. API Gateway can be complexed to configure all by itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "17.  [Exercise: API Gateway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jki_foPde_4)\n",
    "18.  [Postman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wkQjKdY2P0)\n",
    "\n",
    "In Postman, what is the way to send data to a URL via the POST method?\n",
    " * Slect body-> raw and add the JSON data\n",
    " * raw is where we place JSON to send to a URL via a POST request.\n",
    "19.  [Clean Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMEcn8tl00Q)\n",
    "20.   [Edge Cases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvDG7yBS7sc)\n",
    "\n",
    "**When Serverless Is Not the Best Solution**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Serverless is designed for short interactions and requests. If your server takes a long time to process a request or it needs a lot of memory, then serverless might not be a good solution.\n",
    "* Serverless functions do not run constantly. You cannot install and run services such as real webserver with serverless computing.\n",
